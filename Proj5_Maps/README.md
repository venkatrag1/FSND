## KELPINS (Kids' Yelp Pins)

This single-page JS application uses Google Maps API and Yelp Fusion API
to display some of the places of interest for kids in Santa Clara.

To launch the application, unzip the folder and launch index.html.

Click on the marker to view the Yelp data or click on the hamburger icon in the
navigation bar to reveal a list view with real time filtering, from which you can
select the place as well.

You can also view a live version of this page here-
